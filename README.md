About: A Simple Search Voice Bot Project.

Project - (Amanda) Search-Voice-Bot is my first project completed in python. I completed this project whilist learning python. Its still a working progress.

Key Features - What you can do with Amanda Search Voice Bot:
              Speak to it, ask it to search a top in eg.google and it will present the required information back to you. No use for typing. 
              
Tech Stack  - Python, VS Code

The process - Whilist learning Python as my first programming language, to get me into the process of creating or building projects with code, I thought a smiple enough project like the search voice bot would be cool enough. Although created a already, knowing that I am able to code one just like it would boost my confidence. During the building process, and learning along was important for me as this helped me code better. As well as the reseraching how to include and update extension and pip to help with the excecution of the bot. Finally, taking a step away or back to gain clearity and redefine code helped a lot in this process and I wold recommend that to new coders, as this helped me in my learning and application of python during the building process. 

Lessons Learnt - During this project, I've picked up on important skills and a better understanding of complex python ideas, which improved my logical thinking and creative process. 

Areas of Improvement  - A deeper dive into more complex code and functions with Python.

Overall Growth: Each part of this project helped me understand more about what goes into coding, managing complex information, and resilience. It is more than just making a tool or a project. It was about solving a problems, learning new things from what I was taught, and improving my skills for future  development and projects.
